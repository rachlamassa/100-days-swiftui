# Project 2: Guess the Flag

*The second guided project of the course is called 'Guess the Flag' that tests your knowledge of world flags. Players are shown three flag images and must tap the correct one based on the country name.*

I learned how to use images and assets, stacks (VStack, HStack, ZStack) for layouts, buttons and alerts, randomizing arrays, and basic game logic.

The challenge for the project was to implement some features on my own such as adding an @State property to store the user’s score, then displaying it in the alert and in the score label. I also added a new message in the alert when the user guesses incorrectly and I made the game only ask 8 questions. A bonus feature I added myself was adding another array to store what countries were asked already and removing it from the country list. At the end of the game the user gets a new option to play the game again and then the array of countries will merge with the array of previously asked countries.
