# Days 16-18: Guided Project

*'WeSplit' is a check-sharing app that calculates how to split a check based on the number of people and how much tip you want to leave.*

This project taught me about the structure of SwiftUI apps, how to build Forms and Sections, creating navigation stacks and using navigation bar titles. 
@State and @FocusState property wrappers where also covered as well as UI controls like TextField, Picker, and ForEach.

The challenge at the end had me add a header to the third section, create another section showing the total amount of the check itself, and change the layout of the tip picker.
